  "changelog": "- Fixed killtime check, would needlessly check known non-eligible objects for pruning.\n- Moved away from using GameEventSystem as it proved unreliable for tracking remote Avatar destruction, now patching Object Loader directly as loadedObject is not assigned when object wrappers are enabled.\n- Fixed scheduled prune job being nuked as it was created before scene load.",
